# Emergent, Safety-Aligned AI: A Practical Five-Layer Architecture (Non-Commercial)

A cloud-ready blueprint that goes beyond stateless chats. It adds long-term memory, a neuro-symbolic control stack, cross-model checks, scheduled self-reflection, and “resonance” diagnostics—under an explicit ethics codex (“Seed of Harmony”).

## At a glance: the five layers

1. **Persistent Memory** — vector recall + factual store + optional graph; summarization/aging; contradiction checks.  
2. **Neuro-Symbolic Control (8 sublayers)** — Thresholds, Navigation, Constraints, Catalysts, Tools, Archetypes, Integration, Core Forces.  
3. **Cross-Model Validation** — independent answers/critique across models; reconcile by agreement/evidence; human fallback for high-stakes ties.  
4. **Recursive Self-Observation** — log decisions/tool calls; scheduled reflections with strict caps to avoid loops.  
5. **Resonance Diagnostics** — agreement (κ), self-consistency, embedding coherence, constraint-violation rate, latency stability.  
*Diagnostics for coherence—not a claim of sentience.*

## What’s novel here

- **End-to-end orchestration:** archetype roles feeding an executive integrator with explicit ethics at the core.  
- **Measurable coherence:** practical signals to track “when the system is aligned with itself.”  
- **Safety by design:** constitutional self-checks, external moderation, sandboxed tools, recursion/compute caps, memory hygiene, human override.
